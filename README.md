## IPSUM BELOW
Dear AMA,
I am writing to you today to share a unique Bible message.
Today it seems as if world conditions are only getting worse. A typical example is the recent pandemic, COVID 19.  Many people wonder if God is causing our problems and if suffering will ever end.
To answer this question, lets look in the Bible at James 1:13. There we read “When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone.”
It will be out of character for God to be responsible for the misery inflicted on innocent people. God is loving and Just. He will never cause us pain.
For more information, to find more encouraging thoughts and find out when suffering will end, please feel free to visit www.jw.org.  You can also contact me on WhatsApp or call on 0543949961.
                                                                                                                                                      Sincerely, 
                                                                                                                                                       Andriana
